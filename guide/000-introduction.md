Now that you have a feel for what you can use Telegraf for, it's time to learn how to use it!

Telegraf is a very powerful framework, so we'll start simple and build our way up to more complex concepts.

This guide is supposed to be used alongside the [Bot API Documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), and we assume some basic knowledge of JavaScript. If you're completely new to programming, or to JavaScript, we recommend you try these free courses:

* [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20&%20going/README.md)
* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

If you're an experienced user, you can also skip to [Advanced concepts](TODO@mkr//write-article), or the [API documentation](TODO@mkr//link).

If you get stuck, we have community chat groups that welcomes new members.
